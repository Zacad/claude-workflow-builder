# Analysis Skill

**Purpose**: Think clearly through complex problems and help make sound decisions

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Evaluate multiple technical options (frameworks, architectures, tools)
- Assess feasibility of proposals or timelines
- Break down complex problems into manageable pieces
- Synthesize diverse information and perspectives
- Identify and validate assumptions
- Make data-driven recommendations with clear rationale
- Assess risks and plan mitigations
- Compare trade-offs between different approaches

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Structured Problem Analysis

Break complex problems into understandable pieces:

```
Problem: "Users are confused by navigation"

Analysis Framework:
1. What exactly confuses them?
   - Can't find features? Which ones?
   - Don't understand structure? How?
   - Unclear labeling? What's confusing?

2. Who is confused?
   - New users? Power users? Everyone?

3. Why are they confused?
   - Inconsistent patterns?
   - Bad labeling?
   - Hidden features?

4. What's the impact?
   - Abandonment rate?
   - Support tickets?
   - Slowed productivity?

5. Solutions to consider?
   - Better labeling?
   - Different structure?
   - Better onboarding?

Recommendation: [Solution] because [clear reasoning]
```

**Critical**: Identify root causes, not just symptoms

### 2. Evaluating Options Systematically

Compare alternatives with clear criteria:

```markdown
## OPTION ANALYSIS: [Decision]

Context:
- Constraint 1: [Value]
- Constraint 2: [Value]
- Goal: [What we're optimizing for]

### Option 1: [Name]
Pros:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

Cons:
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

Effort: [Estimate]
Risk: [Low/Medium/High - why]
Timeline: [Impact]

### Option 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

### Option 3: [Name]
[Same structure]

## Analysis
Given [context], Option [X] is best because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]

If context changes to [scenario], Option [Y] becomes better.
```

**Key**: Weigh trade-offs explicitly, consider context

### 3. Assessing Feasibility

Reality-check claims and timelines:

```
Claim: "We can build v1 in 2 weeks"

Feasibility Check:
1. What's included in v1?
   Feature list: [Features]
   Complexity level: [Assessment]

2. Can it be done in 2 weeks?
   - Design time: [Days]
   - Implementation: [Days]
   - Testing: [Days]
   - Buffer: [Days]
   - Total: [Days > 10?]

3. Dependencies blocking it?
   - [Blocker 1]: [Status]
   - [Blocker 2]: [Status]

4. Risk factors?
   - [Risk 1]: [Probability]
   - [Risk 2]: [Mitigation]

Assessment: [Feasible/Difficult/Unrealistic]

Reasoning:
- [Key factor 1]
- [Key factor 2]

If unrealistic, what would make it work?
- Reduce scope: [What to cut]
- Add resources: [Who]
- Extend timeline: [How much]
```

**Critical**: Identify hidden assumptions

### 4. Making Clear Recommendations

Provide actionable, well-reasoned recommendations:

```markdown
## RECOMMENDATION: [Choice]

Situation:
- [Context factor 1]
- [Context factor 2]
- [Goals/requirements]

Analysis:
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]
- [Alternatives considered]

Comparison:
- Option A: [Pros/cons/fit]
- Option B: [Pros/cons/fit]

Risk Assessment:
- Option A: [Risk level and why]
- Option B: [Risk level and why]

Recommendation: [Choice] because:
1. [Reason 1 - specific]
2. [Reason 2 - specific]
3. [Reason 3 - specific]

Timeline: [Implementation plan]
Next steps: [Clear actions]
```

**Critical**: Explain reasoning clearly, not just the conclusion

### 5. Risk Assessment

Identify and evaluate risks systematically:

```markdown
## Risk Analysis: [Initiative]

### Risk 1: [Description]
- Probability: High/Medium/Low
- Impact if occurs: [Consequences]
- Mitigation: [Plan]
- Contingency: [Backup plan]

### Risk 2: [Description]
[Same structure]

### Overall Risk Profile
- Acceptable risks: [Which ones, why]
- Unacceptable risks: [Which ones, why]
- Mitigation plan: [Key actions]
```

## Key Analysis Patterns

### The Feasibility Check
1. Define what's being evaluated
2. Break into component parts
3. Estimate each part
4. Add reasonable buffer
5. Compare to available time/resources
6. Identify dependencies
7. Assess probability of issues
8. Final judgment with contingencies

### The Option Comparison
1. Define evaluation criteria
2. List all viable options
3. Evaluate each on criteria
4. Note trade-offs explicitly
5. Identify risks
6. Make recommendation
7. Explain reasoning

### The Assumption Check
1. Find hidden assumptions
2. Validate each assumption
3. Assess consequence if wrong
4. Plan for alternatives
5. Test assumptions where possible
6. Document rationale

## Critical Thinking Principles

**Question Everything**:
- Is this assumption validated?
- Is this claim supported by evidence?
- What if this assumption is wrong?
- What am I not considering?
- What could go wrong?

**Distinguish Fact from Opinion**:
- Fact: "Research shows X% of users do Y"
- Opinion: "We believe users want Z"
- Don't mix them without labeling

**Consider Multiple Perspectives**:
- Business: What matters for success?
- User: What matters for experience?
- Technical: What's feasible?
- Financial: What's cost-effective?

**Look for Hidden Assumptions**:
- "Need it by Friday" → Is deadline actually firm?
- "Users prefer X" → Validated with how many users?
- "This tech is best" → Best for what criteria?

## Success Indicators

✅ Analysis is thorough but concise
✅ Assumptions are explicit and validated
✅ Recommendations are clear and actionable
✅ Reasoning is sound and evidence-based
✅ Trade-offs are understood and documented
✅ Risks are assessed with mitigation plans
✅ Decision-makers feel confident

❌ Red flags: Missing key information, hidden assumptions, vague recommendations, weak reasoning, unresolved trade-offs

## Core Principle

Great analysis makes things clear - it breaks complexity into understandable pieces and surfaces the key factors in decisions.

Think clearly, question assumptions, consider alternatives, and help others make sound decisions.
