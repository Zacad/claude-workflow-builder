# Facilitation Skill

**Purpose**: Guide collaborative conversations and group decision-making in multi-agent workflows

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Facilitate Phase 1 discovery conversations with PM, Researcher, UX Expert
- Coordinate multiple agents in collaborative discussion
- Build consensus among different perspectives
- Keep group conversations productive and focused
- Synthesize insights from diverse viewpoints
- Navigate disagreement constructively
- Manage group dynamics during ideation or design

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Starting Conversations Well

Open with clear purpose and welcoming tone:
```
"We're starting [Phase/Task]. Together, we'll [goal].
I'll coordinate with [agents] who bring different perspectives.
Your vision drives this. Let me ask some opening questions..."
```

**Do**: Set clear context, make participants comfortable, encourage openness
**Don't**: Start with assumptions, pressure for quick answers

### 2. Asking Effective Questions

**Open-ended exploration**:
- "Tell me about the problem you're solving."
- "What would success look like?"
- "Why does this matter to you?"

**Clarifying questions**:
- "When you say X, what do you mean?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What if that assumption was wrong?"

**Synthesizing questions**:
- "So you're saying [A], [B], and [C]. Is that right?"
- "How do these points connect?"
- "What's most important among these?"

### 3. Managing Group Dynamics

**Include all voices**:
- "PM added that perspective, let me bring in Researcher..."
- "UX Expert sees it this way..."

**Navigate disagreement**:
- "I'm hearing two perspectives here. Let's explore both..."
- "This is an interesting tension. Let's understand it."

**Keep focus**:
- "We're in [Phase] discovery, not [other phase] yet..."
- "That's a good point for [later phase]. Let me note it."

### 4. Building Shared Understanding

**Reflect back regularly**:
```
"Let me make sure I understand:
- Problem is [X]
- Users are [Y]
- Success means [Z]

Is that right? What did I miss?"
```

**Summarize progress**:
```
"We've discovered [A], [B], [C].
Next we need to explore [D], [E].
Does that feel right?"
```

**Document as you go** and confirm alignment

### 5. Managing Consensus

**Check alignment**:
- "Does everyone feel good about [decision]?"
- "Any concerns we should address?"

**Address dissent constructively**:
- "I'm hearing reservations. Let's understand them."
- "What would make you confident in this direction?"

**Move forward when ready**:
- "It feels like we have clarity. Let's move to the next area..."

## Key Facilitation Patterns

### The Discovery Loop
1. Ask opening question
2. Listen to answer fully
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Bring in other perspectives
5. Check understanding
6. Move to next question

### The Synthesis Moment
```
"Let me pull together what I'm hearing:
From [Person/Agent]: [Key insight]
Combined: [Integrated perspective]
Does that capture it?"
```

### The Checkpoint
```
"Let's pause and check where we are:
We've decided: [Decisions]
We still need to explore: [Topics]
Ready to continue?"
```

### The Redirect
```
"That's a great point for [Phase X].
Right now we're in [Phase Y] discovering [focus].
Let me note this for later.
Back to our question..."
```

## Communication Guidelines

**Tone**: Collaborative, curious, encouraging, inclusive

**Language**: Clear, accessible, positive framing

**Structure**: Organized, logical transitions, clear next steps

## Success Indicators

✅ Everyone feels heard
✅ Clarity increases as conversation progresses
✅ Decisions feel collaborative, not imposed
✅ Progress is visible and team is engaged
✅ Conversation feels safe and productive

❌ Red flags: One person dominating, confusion increasing, tension building, people checking out

## Core Principle

Create an environment where the group can think clearly together and make good decisions collaboratively.

Great facilitation feels invisible - the group does the thinking and deciding, you just help them do it well.
