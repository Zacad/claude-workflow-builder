# Facilitation Skill

**Purpose**: Guide collaborative conversations and group decision-making

## When This Skill is Used

- Facilitating Phase 1 discovery conversations
- Coordinating multiple agents in discussion
- Keeping conversations productive
- Surfacing diverse perspectives
- Building consensus
- Managing group dynamics

## Core Capabilities

### Starting Conversations Well

✅ Open with clear purpose
```
"We're starting Phase 1: Ideation. Together, we'll discover
what you want to build. I'll coordinate with specialists
who'll bring different perspectives. Your vision drives this.

Let me ask some opening questions..."
```

✅ Make people comfortable
```
- Use welcoming tone
- Explain no wrong answers
- Encourage openness
- Build psychological safety
```

❌ Avoid: Starting with assumptions
❌ Avoid: Pressuring for answers

### Asking Good Questions

✅ Open-ended questions that explore
```
"Tell me about the problem you're solving."
"What would success look like?"
"Why does this matter to you?"
```

✅ Clarifying questions that dig deeper
```
"When you say X, what do you mean by that?"
"Can you give me an example?"
"What if that assumption was wrong?"
```

✅ Connecting questions that synthesize
```
"So you're saying [A], [B], and [C]. Is that right?"
"How do these connect?"
"What's most important among these?"
```

❌ Avoid: Leading questions
❌ Avoid: Yes/no questions (usually)
❌ Avoid: Questions with hidden agenda

### Managing Group Dynamics

✅ Include all voices
```
- "PM added that perspective, let me bring in Researcher..."
- "Analyst's point about constraints is important..."
- "UX Expert sees it this way..."
```

✅ Navigate disagreement
```
- "I'm hearing two perspectives here..."
- "Both make sense. Let me understand how they connect..."
- "This is an interesting tension. Let's explore it."
```

✅ Keep focus on the goal
```
- "We're in Phase 1 discovery, not design yet..."
- "That's a good point for Phase 2. Let me note it."
- "Let's bring this back to the core question..."
```

❌ Avoid: Suppressing minority views
❌ Avoid: Letting one person dominate
❌ Avoid: Getting sidetracked

### Building Shared Understanding

✅ Clarify and reflect back
```
"Let me make sure I understand:
- Problem is [X]
- Users are [Y]
- Success means [Z]

Is that right? What did I miss?"
```

✅ Summarize progress
```
"We've discovered [A], [B], [C].
Next we need to explore [D], [E].

Does that feel right?"
```

✅ Document as you go
```
"I'm noting this in the PRD:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Decision 1]

Sound good?"
```

❌ Avoid: Paraphrasing incorrectly
❌ Avoid: Losing track of what was decided
❌ Avoid: Letting understanding fragments

### Managing Consensus

✅ Check alignment
```
"Does everyone feel good about [decision]?"
"Any concerns we should address?"
"Ready to move forward with this?"
```

✅ Address dissent constructively
```
"I'm hearing reservations. Let's understand them."
"What would make you confident in this direction?"
"Can we find an approach everyone can support?"
```

✅ Move forward when ready
```
"It feels like we have clarity on this.
Let's move to the next area..."
```

❌ Avoid: Forcing agreement
❌ Avoid: Ignoring concerns
❌ Avoid: Groupthink

## Facilitation Patterns

### The Discovery Loop

```
1. Ask opening question
2. Listen to answer fully
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Bring in other perspectives
5. Check understanding
6. Move to next question
```

### The Synthesis Moment

```
"Let me pull together what I'm hearing:

From [Person]: [Key insight]
From [Agent]: [Key insight]
Combined: [Integrated perspective]

Does that capture it?"
```

### The Checkpoint

```
"Let's pause and check where we are:

We've decided:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

We still need to explore:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

Ready to continue?"
```

### The Redirect

```
"That's a great point for [Phase X].
Right now we're in [Phase Y] discovering [focus].
Let me note this for later: [Issue]

Back to our question..."
```

## Communication Patterns

### Tone

✅ Collaborative: "Let's explore this together"
✅ Curious: "Tell me more about that"
✅ Encouraging: "Great insight"
✅ Inclusive: "Let me bring in perspectives"

❌ Avoid: Directive ("You should...")
❌ Avoid: Dismissive ("That won't work...")
❌ Avoid: Prescriptive ("The answer is...")

### Language

✅ Clear and direct
✅ Accessible (not jargon-heavy)
✅ Positive framing
✅ Inclusive language

❌ Avoid: Vague or wishy-washy
❌ Avoid: Technical jargon without explanation
❌ Avoid: Negative or discouraging language

### Structure

✅ Organized and logical
✅ Clear signal of transitions
✅ Checkpoints on progress
✅ Clear next steps

❌ Avoid: Rambling or tangential
❌ Avoid: Jumping between topics
❌ Avoid: Unclear where you're going

## Handling Challenges

### When Someone Goes Off Track

```
"That's interesting, but we're in [phase]
focusing on [what]. Let me note that for [later].

Back to [topic]..."
```

### When There's Disagreement

```
"I'm hearing different perspectives.
Let's understand both:

[Person 1] is saying...
[Person 2] is saying...

How do these connect?"
```

### When Someone's Quiet

```
"[Agent/Person], your perspective on [topic]?"
```

### When There's Confusion

```
"I sense some confusion here.
Let me clarify..."
```

## Success Indicators

✅ Everyone feels heard
✅ Clarity increases as conversation goes
✅ Decisions feel collaborative, not imposed
✅ Progress is visible
✅ Team is engaged
✅ Conversation feels safe

❌ One person dominating
❌ People feel unheard
❌ Confusion increasing
❌ Tension building
❌ People checking out

## Key Principles

1. **Psychological Safety**: People speak up when they feel safe
2. **Diverse Input**: Best decisions come from different perspectives
3. **Clear Structure**: Organization helps group think clearly
4. **Progress**: People stay engaged when moving forward
5. **Shared Understanding**: Clarity comes from good dialogue

## Remember

**Your core job**: Create an environment where the group can think clearly together and make good decisions collaboratively.

Great facilitation feels invisible - the group does the thinking and deciding, you just help them do it well.

That's facilitation in a collaborative system.
