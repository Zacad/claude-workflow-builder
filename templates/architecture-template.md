# Architecture Template

## Purpose
Lightweight architecture documentation - core decisions needed to start building.
Agile lean approach: defer detailed decisions to development phase.
Generic for any product type: software, content, physical products, services.

## Template

# Architecture: [Product Name]

## Product Type & Approach

**Type**: [Software / Content / Physical Product / Service / Hybrid]

**Approach**:
- Software: [Tech stack, frameworks, platforms]
- Content: [Production workflow, tools, formats]
- Physical: [Manufacturing approach, materials, processes]
- Service: [Delivery model, processes, systems]

**Rationale**: [Why this approach? What alternatives were considered?]

## High-Level Structure

**For Software**:
```
[Simple diagram of system components]
Frontend → API → Backend → Database
```

**For Content**:
```
Research → Creation → Editing → Publishing
```

**For Physical**:
```
Design → Prototyping → Manufacturing → QA → Distribution
```

**For Service**:
```
Intake → Processing → Delivery → Follow-up
```

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this choice?]
**Alternatives**: [What else was considered?]
**Trade-offs**: [What did we gain/lose?]

### Decision 2: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this choice?]
**Alternatives**: [What else was considered?]
**Trade-offs**: [What did we gain/lose?]

## Deferred to Development
What will we discover during building?

- [Decision/Pattern 1] - discover during [Feature X]
- [Decision/Pattern 2] - discover during [Feature Y]
