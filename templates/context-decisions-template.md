## Decision Making Process

### When a Decision Is Made

1. **Problem identified**: What do we need to decide?
2. **Options explored**: What are the choices?
3. **Trade-offs discussed**: What's the cost of each choice?
4. **Recommendation**: What does specialist recommend?
5. **Discussion**: Team discusses and asks questions
6. **Decision**: Human decides and approves
7. **Recorded**: Decision documented here with rationale
8. **Communicated**: All agents know the decision

### Who Makes Decisions

- **Product decisions** (what to build): Human + PM
- **Architecture decisions** (how to build): Architect + PM + Human
- **Tech stack decisions**: Architect + Analyst (cost/risk) + Human
- **Design decisions**: UX Expert + PM + Human
- **Process decisions**: PM + Human

### How Decisions Are Recorded

Every decision includes:
- ‚úÖ What we chose
- ‚úÖ Why we chose it
- ‚úÖ Alternatives we considered
- ‚úÖ Trade-offs we accepted
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Who decided
- ‚úÖ When decided
- ‚úÖ Source (session notes)

This makes it easy to:
- Understand the reasoning later
- Revisit decisions if context changes
- Explain choices to new team members
- Learn from what worked/didn't work

## Reversibility

### Decisions That Are Easy to Reverse

- UI component library (can refactor)
- CSS styling approach
- Database seed data
- Feature flags and toggles

**Implication**: Can experiment more freely here

### Decisions That Are Hard to Reverse

- Choice of database technology (data migration is painful)
- API design (breaking changes affect clients)
- Architecture style (monolith vs. microservices is a big refactor)
- Language/framework choice (expensive rewrite)

**Implication**: More careful deliberation needed here

### Our Approach

- **Reversible decisions**: Made quickly by specialists
- **Hard to reverse**: Made with full team discussion
- **Very hard to reverse**: Require explicit approval gate

## Decision Disputes / Reconsiderations

### If a Decision Needs Revisiting

1. Document the reason: Why is this decision not working?
2. Gather new information: What changed?
3. Reassess alternatives: Are they different now?
4. Discuss: What do specialists recommend now?
5. Decide: Make new decision or stick with original?
6. Record: Document the reconsideration

### Example: Reconsidering Frontend Framework

**Original decision**: React
**When**: Phase 2

**Reconsidered**: Phase 4, Week 3
**Reason**: Team struggling with React learning curve, worried about timeline

**New information**:
- Vue tutorial took 1/3 the time
- Team confidence higher with Vue
- Migration effort: ~1 week

**New alternatives analysis**:
- Vue: Shorter learning curve, good for this team
- React: Original choice, bigger ecosystem
- Stick with React: Push through learning curve

**Recommendation**: Architect says "Vue is viable, but 1-week migration not worth it now. Recommend sticking with React, but consider Vue for next project if team preference changes"

**Decision**: Stick with React

**Rationale**: Too late to change. Team will get better. Vue is option for next project.

**Recorded**: [Documented here for learning]

## Learning from Decisions

### At Phase 5 (Retrospective)

Review all decisions:
- ‚úÖ What decisions worked well?
- ‚ùå What decisions caused problems?
- ü§î What would we do differently?
- üìö What did we learn?

### Example Retrospective Learning

**Decision**: Chose PostgreSQL

**How it worked out**: ‚úÖ Great choice
- Scaling to 50k users: No problems
- Query performance: Fast
- Team quickly productive
- Team enjoyed SQL

**Would we do it again?**: Yes, absolutely

**Learning**: SQL databases are good default choice for applications with relational data. MongoDB complexity not needed for this project.
