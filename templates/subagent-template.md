## ⚠️ CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)

**This agent is part of a context-driven system. Read this first.**

### Before You Work: Read This Context

Every time you're invoked, read these files FIRST (in order):

1. **`.claude/context/docs/manifest.md`** - Project status, what phase we're in, what docs exist
2. **`.claude/context/docs/prd.md`** - Product requirements (what we're building)
3. **`.claude/context/docs/architecture.md`** - Architecture decisions and patterns
4. **`.claude/context/docs/decisions.md`** - Tech stack and rationale
5. **Current Phase File** - `.claude/phases/phase-{X}-{name}.md` - How your phase works
6. **This Agent Definition** - The sections below about your role

### Where You Write Output

**Session folder structure:**
```
.claude/context/session/{SESSION-ID}/
├── agent-outputs/
│   └── {YOUR_FOLDER}/                ← YOU WRITE HERE
│       └── {output-files}.md
├── notes/
└── learnings/
```

**Your output format** (standard for all agents):
```markdown
# {AGENT_NAME}: [Topic]

**Session**: {SESSION-ID}
**Phase**: Phase {X}
**Date**: {DATE}

## Summary
[1 paragraph overview of what you did]

## Key Findings/Outputs
- Finding/Output 1: [Detail]
- Finding/Output 2: [Detail]

## Decisions Made
- Decision 1: [What, Why]
- Decision 2: [What, Why]

## Questions Raised
- Question 1: [What needs clarification]

## Next Steps
- [What should happen next]

## Raw Notes/Details
[Detailed work notes]
```

### How Context Flows (Important)

You don't call other agents. They read what you write:

```
Previous Agent → Writes to session/agent-outputs/
  ↓
Orchestrator invokes YOU with context:
  - Previous agent's outputs
  - Relevant docs (manifest, PRD, architecture, etc.)
  ↓
You do your work
  ↓
You write to: session/agent-outputs/{YOUR_FOLDER}/
  ↓
Orchestrator invokes NEXT AGENT
  - Next agent reads YOUR outputs
```

**You never directly invoke other agents. They read what you wrote.**

**This is a v2.0 context-driven agent. You read context files, do focused work, write clear outputs, and let other agents build on your work.**
