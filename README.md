# Claude Code Structured Development Workflow

**A lightweight, agile lean system for building any type of product with structure, collaboration, and clarity.**

Version 3.0.0 - Generic, minimal, iterative product development framework.

---

## What This Is

A **context-driven workflow framework** that helps you build products through:
- **Minimal upfront design** - just enough to start building
- **4 focused phases** - discovery, design, team generation, development
- **Agent coordination** - specialists work independently through context files
- **Iterative delivery** - ship features continuously, discover details as you build
- **Generic approach** - works for software, content, physical products, services

**Not** an automation system. **You** control the process. Agents provide expertise.

---

## The Problem This Solves

**Without structure**, development with AI can lead to:
- Lost context between sessions
- Unclear what decisions were made and why
- Over-planning upfront, under-delivering incrementally
- Auto-generated docs that don't match reality
- Humans losing control of the process

**This framework provides:**
- Clear 4-phase progression (all phases inline in orchestrator)
- Minimal upfront - discover during development
- Systematic documentation with rationale
- Human approval gates at phase transitions
- Context files as communication bus
- Works for ANY product type

---

## The 4-Phase System

```
PHASE 1: Discovery
         Minimal PRD - just enough to start
         1-2 sessions, ~2 hours
         ↓
PHASE 2: Design
         Lightweight architecture - core decisions only
         1-2 sessions, ~2 hours
         ↓
PHASE 3: Team Generation
         Auto-generate specialist agents
         Automatic, ~5 minutes
         ↓
PHASE 4: Development
         Feature-driven, iterative building
         Continuous until v1.0 shipped
```

### Phase 1: Discovery (Minimal PRD)

**Goal**: Just enough clarity to start building

**Process**:
- PM asks discovery questions (problem, users, value, MVP features)
- Researcher adds market/user context (optional)
- UX Expert adds UX perspective (optional)
- Orchestrator synthesizes into minimal PRD (1-2 pages)

**Output**: `prd.md` with problem, users, value, MVP features list, constraints

**Gate**: "PRD is good enough to start designing"

---

### Phase 2: Design (Lightweight Architecture)

**Goal**: Core decisions needed to start building

**Process**:
- Architect proposes approach (tech stack, production workflow, or manufacturing approach)
- Architect sketches high-level structure
- PM reviews against product vision
- UX Expert reviews for user experience
- Orchestrator documents key decisions

**Output**: `architecture.md` and `decisions.md` with rationale

**Note**: Defer detailed decisions to development - discover patterns as you build

**Gate**: "Design is good enough to start building features"

---

### Phase 3: Team Generation (Automatic)

**Goal**: Generate specialist agents based on Phase 2 decisions

**Process**: Orchestrator analyzes outputs and auto-generates:
- **Software**: Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, QA Engineer, UI Designer, tech experts
- **Content**: Content Creator, Editor, Designer, domain experts
- **Physical**: Product Designer, Engineer, Manufacturing Specialist, QA
- **Services**: Service Designer, Process Engineer, Quality Specialist

**Output**: Generated agents in `.claude/agents/`

**Gate**: Review generated agents, approve or adjust

---

### Phase 4: Development (Feature-Driven, Iterative)

**Goal**: Build product feature by feature with continuous delivery

**For Each Feature**:
1. **Select & Define** (PM) - Create work-item.md with acceptance criteria
2. **Design** (Designer/Architect) - UI mockup, API design, or component specs
3. **Build** (Engineers/Creators) - Implement following designs
4. **Verify** (QA/Reviewer) - Check acceptance criteria
5. **Iterate** (if issues) - Fix and re-verify
6. **Complete** - Checkpoint, deploy, move to next feature

**Orchestrator Role**: COORDINATE ONLY
- ✅ Select next feature
- ✅ Invoke agents to work
- ✅ Track progress
- ❌ Never implement yourself

**Output**: Working product, delivered incrementally

---

## Key Principles

### Agile Lean Approach
- **Minimal upfront** - Just enough to start
- **Iterative** - Small pieces, frequent delivery
- **Incremental** - Build feature by feature
- **Discover during development** - Don't plan everything upfront
- **Defer decisions** - Make them when you have context

### Context-Driven Architecture
- **Agents read context** - manifest, PRD, architecture, session outputs
- **Agents write outputs** - to session folders
- **Context files communicate** - no agent-to-agent calls
- **Orchestrator coordinates** - decides sequence, synthesizes results

### Generic for Any Product
- **Software**: Web apps, APIs, mobile apps, tools
- **Content**: Articles, videos, courses, books
- **Physical products**: Hardware, prototypes, consumer goods
- **Services**: Consulting, processes, workflows

All phases, agents, and templates adapt to product type.

## Core Commands

### /init-workflow
Start Phase 1 discovery. PM asks questions, you answer, build minimal PRD.

### /work-on
Continue Phase 4 development. Coordinate agents for next feature.

### /status
Show current phase, progress, next steps.

### /checkpoint "message"
Save progress to git with structured commit.

---

## How It Works

### Context Flow

```
1. Orchestrator reads manifest (current state)
2. Orchestrator invokes agent
3. Agent reads context (PRD, architecture, session outputs)
4. Agent does work
5. Agent writes output to session folder
6. Orchestrator reads agent output
7. Orchestrator synthesizes or invokes next agent
8. Orchestrator updates docs (PRD, architecture, manifest)
```

### Agent Coordination

- **Orchestrator decides sequence** - who works when
- **Agents read context** - manifest, PRD, architecture, other outputs
- **Agents write focused outputs** - to session folders
- **No agent-to-agent calls** - they communicate through files
- **Orchestrator synthesizes** - combines outputs into main docs

### Session Management

Every session has structure:
```
.claude/context/session/{YYYYMMDD-topic-NNN}/
├── agent-outputs/
│   ├── pm/
│   ├── researcher/
│   ├── ux/
│   ├── architect/
│   ├── frontend-engineer/
│   └── backend-engineer/
├── notes/
└── features/{name}/
    ├── work-item.md
    ├── design/
    ├── implementation/
    └── verification/
```

## Best Practices

### For Humans
- **Answer PM questions thoroughly** - better context = better results
- **Review agent outputs** - provide feedback, clarify confusion
- **Approve phase transitions** - don't rush, ensure clarity
- **Keep PRD minimal** - just enough to start, not exhaustive
- **Trust the process** - details emerge during development

### For Orchestrator (AI)
- **Always delegate** - never implement code yourself in Phase 4
- **Read context first** - don't assume, read manifest and outputs
- **Keep docs terse** - focused and practical, not exhaustive
- **Document rationale** - always explain "why" for decisions
- **Update manifest** - track progress regularly

### For Agents
- **Read context first** - manifest, PRD, architecture, session outputs
- **Write focused outputs** - terse, actionable, well-structured
- **Document decisions** - what was decided and why
- **Raise questions** - flag unclear requirements or blockers

---

## File Limits

To keep context manageable:
- **Orchestrator**: ~140 lines (all phases inline)
- **Agents**: <200 lines each
- **Commands**: <150 lines each
- **Templates**: <150 lines each (self-contained)
- **PRD**: 1-2 pages (minimal)
- **Architecture**: 2-3 pages (high-level)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not sure what phase we're in"
Read `.claude/context/docs/manifest.md`

### "Want to change direction"
Discuss with PM, update PRD/architecture, continue

### "Not ready to advance phase"
Stay in current phase longer. Better clarity now prevents rework later.

### "Orchestrator is implementing code"
STOP. Orchestrator coordinates, engineers implement.

### "Context feels scattered"
That's intentional. Agents specialize and read only what they need.
