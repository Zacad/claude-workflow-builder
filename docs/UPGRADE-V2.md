# Version 2.0 - Dynamic Workflow System

**Bob here. I've completely redesigned the system based on your feedback.**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### OLD Approach (v1.0)
❌ Static templates
❌ Generic commands that might not fit
❌ You had to customize everything manually
❌ Commands existed but didn't work (`/init-workflow` error)

### NEW Approach (v2.0)
✅ **Claude dynamically creates commands and skills**
✅ **Tailored to YOUR project's tech stack**
✅ **Commands work immediately after initialization**
✅ **Intelligent adaptation, not templates**

---

## 📦 Installation (Same as Before)

```bash
# Copy folder to project
cp -r claude-code-workflow /your/project/

# Run installer
cd /your/project/claude-code-workflow
./install.sh
```

**What installer creates:**
```
.claude/
├── claude.md           (Smart orchestrator)
├── commands/           (Empty - Claude fills this)
├── skills/             (Empty - Claude fills this)
└── context/
    ├── docs/
    ├── session/
    ├── templates/
    └── agents/
```

---

## 🚀 Usage (NEW Flow)

### Step 1: Install
```bash
./install.sh
```

### Step 2: Open Claude Code in your project
```bash
cd /your/project
# Open Claude Code here
```

### Step 3: Initialize (Natural Language)
In Claude Code, just say:
```
Initialize the workflow system for this project
```

### Step 4: Claude Analyzes & Creates
Claude will:
1. **Analyze your project**
   - Read package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
   - Detect: React? Vue? Node? Python? Django? etc.

2. **Present a plan** like:
   ```
   Detected:
   - Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
   - Backend: Node.js + Express
   - Testing: Jest
   
   I will create:
   Commands: /init-workflow, /init-session, /status, /checkpoint, /test, /lint
   Skills: code-quality, test-generator, react-patterns
   Subagents: frontend-react, backend-node, testing-jest
   
   Proceed?
   ```

3. **Create everything** after your approval

4. **Report completion**:
   ```
   Created 6 commands, 3 skills, 3 subagents.
   Documentation in .claude/context/docs/
   
   You can now use:
   /init-workflow
   /init-session "your task"
   /status
   /checkpoint "message"
   /test
   /lint
   ```

### Step 5: Use Your Custom Workflow
```
/init-session "Add user authentication"
[work on feature]
/status
/checkpoint "Completed login feature"
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### claude.md = The Orchestrator
The `claude.md` file contains instructions for Claude on:
- How to analyze projects
- How to create slash command files
- How to create skill directories
- Command vs skill decision logic
- File formats and structures

### Commands (.claude/commands/)
- **Created dynamically** by Claude during initialization
- **Format**: `.md` files (e.g., `status.md`)
- **User-invoked**: You type `/status` to run
- **Project-specific**: Tailored to your stack

### Skills (.claude/skills/)
- **Created dynamically** by Claude during initialization
- **Format**: Directories with `SKILL.md` file
- **Model-invoked**: Claude uses automatically when relevant
- **Composable**: Multiple skills work together

### Example for React + Node Project
Claude creates:
```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── init-workflow.md
│   ├── init-session.md
│   ├── status.md
│   ├── checkpoint.md
│   ├── test.md         (Jest detected)
│   └── lint.md         (ESLint detected)
├── skills/
│   ├── code-quality/SKILL.md
│   ├── test-generator/SKILL.md
│   └── react-patterns/SKILL.md
└── context/
    └── agents/
        ├── frontend-react-agent.md
        └── backend-node-agent.md
```

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Aspect | v1.0 (Old) | v2.0 (New) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Commands** | Static templates | Dynamically created |
| **Skills** | Didn't exist | Dynamically created |
| **Tech Stack** | Generic | Project-specific |
| **Setup** | Manual customization | Automatic analysis |
| **Error** | `/init-workflow` not found | Commands work immediately |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed workflow | Adapts to project |

---

## ✅ Benefits

### 1. Zero Configuration
No editing config files. Claude figures it out.

### 2. Perfect Fit
Commands and skills match YOUR tech stack, not generic templates.

### 3. Extensible
Claude can create new commands/skills as project evolves.

### 4. Intelligent
Skills auto-compose. Claude knows when to use what.

### 5. Clean
Installer auto-gitignored. Delete anytime.

## 🎬 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
cd claude-code-workflow
./install.sh

# 2. Open Claude Code in project
cd /your/project

# 3. Initialize (in Claude Code)
"Initialize the workflow system for this project"

# 4. Approve Claude's plan

# 5. Use your workflow
/init-session "First task"
```

**Time: 2 minutes**

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Problem You Identified
Static commands existed but didn't work because Claude Code requires actual `.md` files in `.claude/commands/`. My v1.0 had instructions in `claude.md` but no actual command files.

### Solution
Let Claude CREATE the actual command files dynamically based on your project. Claude reads the orchestrator instructions, analyzes your project, and writes the proper `.md` files that Claude Code recognizes.

### Result
- Commands work immediately after init
- Perfect fit for your project
- No manual configuration
- Self-adapting system

## 🔄 Upgrading from v1.0

If you installed v1.0:
```bash
# Remove old installation
rm -rf .claude/

# Install v2.0
cd claude-code-workflow
./install.sh

# Reinitialize (Claude will create commands properly)
"Initialize the workflow system for this project"
```
