# Phase 5: Delivery - Release, Retrospective & Context Capture

**Duration**: 1-2 days (focused sprint)
**Triggered By**: You decide "we're ready to release v1.0"
**System Role**: Coordinate release, capture retrospective, document context for future
**Your Role**: Reviewer, decision-maker, retrospective facilitator
**Outcome**: v1.0 shipped, lessons captured, v1.1 roadmap planned

---

## Phase 5 Overview

### What Happens

After Phase 4 features are complete, you decide to release. Phase 5 does 4 things:

1. **Final QA**: Comprehensive system-wide testing
2. **Release**: Deploy v1.0 to production with release notes
3. **Retrospective**: Conduct full project retrospective, capture learnings
4. **Planning**: Create v1.1 roadmap and identify technical debt

All outputs documented in session folder. All learnings captured to `.claude/context/docs/` for future reference.

### How It Works

```
Phase 4 Complete: Multiple features shipped to production
  â†“
You: "Ready to release v1.0"
  â†“
Orchestrator creates Phase 5 session
  â†“
QA Expert reads: All feature outputs, architecture, decisions
QA Expert does: Comprehensive system testing
QA Expert writes: Final QA report to session/
  â†“
PM reads: All features, QA report
PM does: Create release notes and changelog
PM writes: Release documentation
  â†“
DevOps reads: QA report, deployment checklists
DevOps does: Deploy v1.0 to production
DevOps writes: Deployment report
  â†“
Team conducts: Full project retrospective
Team documents: What went well, what could improve, key decisions
Team writes: Retrospective summary to context/docs/
  â†“
Orchestrator synthesizes:
- .claude/context/docs/retrospective-v1.0.md
- .claude/context/docs/metrics-v1.0.md
- .claude/context/docs/roadmap.md
- Updated manifest with Phase 5 complete
  â†“
âœ… v1.0 SHIPPED & LESSONS CAPTURED
```

## Context Architecture

### What Agents Read (Inputs)

**Phase 5 agents start with complete project context:**

All agents read:
- `.claude/context/docs/manifest.md` (project status)
- `.claude/context/docs/prd.md` (what we built)
- `.claude/context/docs/architecture.md` (how it's built)
- `.claude/context/docs/decisions.md` (why choices were made)
- All Phase 4 feature session folders (everything built)
- `.claude/context/session/{PHASE4-SESSIONS}/learnings/` (patterns from features)

### What Agents Write (Outputs)

**All outputs go to**: `.claude/context/session/{SESSION-ID}/agent-outputs/` AND `.claude/context/docs/`

```
session/{SESSION-ID}/agent-outputs/
â”œâ”€â”€ qa/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ final-qa-report.md
â”œâ”€â”€ pm/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ release-notes-v1.0.md
â”œâ”€â”€ devops/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deployment-v1.0.md
â””â”€â”€ team/
    â””â”€â”€ retrospective-v1.0.md

Finalized outputs copied to context/docs/:
â”œâ”€â”€ retrospective-v1.0.md (for future reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ metrics-v1.0.md (development metrics)
â”œâ”€â”€ roadmap.md (v1.1 planning)
â””â”€â”€ deployment-log.md (production history)
```

## Phase 5 Steps: Release & Learn

### Step 1: Final QA

**QA Expert reads**: All Phase 4 feature reports, architecture, decisions
**QA Expert writes to**: `session/agent-outputs/qa/final-qa-report.md`

**QA Expert conducts comprehensive testing**:

```
FINAL QA REPORT: v1.0 Release Candidate

SYSTEM-WIDE TESTING:
âœ“ All features end-to-end (workflows tested)
âœ“ Cross-feature interactions (feature combinations)
âœ“ Error handling (edge cases, boundary conditions)
âœ“ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
âœ“ Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
âœ“ Performance (load times, response times, database)
âœ“ Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions)
âœ“ Devices (Desktop, tablet, mobile - responsive design)
âœ“ Load testing (100, 1000 concurrent users)

DATABASE & INFRASTRUCTURE:

```

---

### Step 2: Release Preparation & Deployment

**PM reads**: QA report, all features, PRD
**PM writes to**: `session/agent-outputs/pm/release-notes-v1.0.md`

**PM creates release notes**:

```
# Release Notes: Project App v1.0.0

### Step 3: Retrospective & Learning

**Team conducts full project retrospective**

Team reads: All phase outputs, all feature learnings, all decisions
Team writes to: `session/agent-outputs/team/retrospective-v1.0.md` AND `.claude/context/docs/`

**Full Project Retrospective**:

```
RETROSPECTIVE: v1.0.0 Development

PROJECT TIMELINE:
- Phase 1 (Ideation): [X days]
- Phase 2 (Design): [X days]
- Phase 3 (Agent Gen): [X days]
- Phase 4 (Development): [X days]
- Phase 5 (Delivery): [X days]
- Total: [Days]
```

## What Went Well

âœ“ PRD stayed stable (minimal changes)
âœ“ Design was comprehensive
âœ“ Architecture supported all features
âœ“ Testing caught issues early
âœ“ No critical production bugs
âœ“ Deployment smooth

## What Could Improve

- Phase 1 research could be deeper
- Feature definitions sometimes vague
- Documentation should start earlier
- Security planning should be in design phase
- Rate limiting should be planned upfront

## Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

All major decisions documented with:
- What was chosen
- Why it was chosen
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs accepted
- Impact on product

Example:
- Tech stack: React+Node+PostgreSQL (fast dev, familiar)
- Architecture: Monolith (simpler deployment)
- Features: Email auth only (MVP focus)

## Metrics Captured

- Total timeline: [X days]
- Features delivered: [X]
- Test coverage: [X%]
- Production bugs: [X]
- Performance targets: [Met/Exceeded]
- Team velocity: [X features/day]

## Learnings for v1.1

From retrospective and all feature sessions:
- Reusable patterns discovered
- Code and process improvements
- What to do differently
- What to keep doing
```

### Step 4: Future Planning

**Team plans v1.1 based on retrospective learnings**:

```
v1.1 ROADMAP:

Based on Phase 4 feature learnings + retrospective:

QUICK WINS:
- [Feature based on pattern discovered]
- [Feature based on user feedback]

MEDIUM FEATURES:
- [Feature that unblocks growth]
- [Feature that improves core flow]

FUTURE:
- [Long-term strategic feature]
- [Technical improvements]

TECHNICAL DEBT:
- [Refactorings]
- [Scaling preparations]
```

## Success Criteria for Phase 5

âœ… Final QA comprehensive and passed
âœ… v1.0.0 deployed to production
âœ… Release notes published
âœ… Retrospective conducted
âœ… Learnings documented
âœ… v1.1 roadmap created
âœ… All context stored for future

## After Phase 5: Three Paths

**Option 1: Continue with v1.1**
```
User: Ready for v1.1

System: Starting Phase 1 for v1.1 (with v1.0 context)
All lessons, patterns, and decisions available
Let's plan next features...
```

**Option 2: Monitor v1.0**
```
User: Let's watch v1.0 for a while first

System: Good idea. Monitor production, gather feedback.
Commands: /status, /pivot, /init-session for hotfixes

When ready for v1.1: /init-workflow
```

**Option 3: Pivot Direction**
```
User: We're changing direction

System: Let's revisit the product vision
[Discuss via /pivot]
```

---

## Key Principles for Phase 5

1. **Context-Driven**: Capture learnings in context docs
2. **Comprehensive**: Test system-wide, not just features
3. **Honest**: Record what went wrong, not just what went right
4. **Learning-Focused**: Every decision and metric documented
5. **Future-Ready**: Context available for next phases

---

**Phase 5 closes one chapter and opens the next.**

You shipped v1.0. All your learning is captured. Your context is preserved.

Ready to keep building? The foundation is solid.

ðŸš€ **Time to grow.**
