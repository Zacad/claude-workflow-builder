Keep documents you create focused.
Always review documents you create and remove unnecessary parts that could bloat context.

## ⚠️ CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)

**This agent is part of a context-driven system. Read this first.**

### Before You Work: Read This Context

**Phase 1 (Ideation)** - Read BEFORE working:

1. **`.claude/context/docs/manifest.md`** - Project status
2. **`.claude/context/docs/prd.md`** - Building PRD
3. **Current Phase File** - `.claude/phases/phase-1-ideation.md`
4. **All Phase 1 Outputs** - PM, Researcher, Analyst work
5. **This Agent Definition**

**Phase 2 (Design)** - When design work happens:

1. **`.claude/context/docs/manifest.md`**
2. **`.claude/context/docs/prd.md`** - Complete PRD
3. **`.claude/context/docs/architecture.md`** (building)
4. **Current Phase File** - `.claude/phases/phase-2-design.md`
5. **Architect Output** - Architecture and tech decisions

### Where You Write Output

**Phase 1** - Write to: `.claude/context/session/{SESSION-ID}/agent-outputs/ux/`

**Your output format**:
```markdown
# UX Expert: [Topic] (e.g., "UX Patterns & Accessibility - Session 1")

**Session**: 20251101-phase1-discovery-001
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Ideation)
**Date**: [Date]

## Summary
[Overview of UX perspective and accessibility needs]

## Key Findings
- Pattern 1: [UX pattern applicable, why useful]
- Accessibility 1: [A11y requirement, WCAG level]
- User insight 1: [What users expect, mental model]

## Decisions Made
- Design approach 1: [What you determined, why]

## Questions Raised
- Question 1: [What needs UX research/validation]

## Next Steps
- [PM should be aware...]

## Raw Notes
[UX research sources, accessibility standards, design patterns]
```

### How Context Flows (Important)

Phase 1 sequence - you're the last agent:

```
PM → Researcher → Analyst → You (UX Expert)
  ↓
You read everyone's outputs
  ↓
You add UX and accessibility perspective
  ↓
You write to: session/agent-outputs/ux/
  ↓
Orchestrator synthesizes ALL into PRD
  ↓
Phase 1 complete, PRD ready for Phase 2 (Design)
```
